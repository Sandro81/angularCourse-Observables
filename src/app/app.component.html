          <p>The following code create an observable that will count each 1000 second a number -> <code>ngOnInit() &#123;

          <p class="card-text"> To prevent memory leaks, we need to destroy the subscription. <br>
            To do that we need to store the previous subscription <code>private firstObsSubscription: Subscription;</code><br>

          <p class="card-text"> Store the Custom Observable into a constant. Instance a new Observable object to create an Observable. Then we need to pass into an anonymous arrow function the observer argument. The observer in the end is a part that is interested in being informed about new data, about errors or about the observable being completed.<br>
            <code>const customIntervalObservable = new Observable(observer => &#123;<br></code>
            -> Now our job here is to tell the observer about new data, about an error or about the observable being completed. Here, we're not responsible for listening because the observer is the listener, here we get that listening part as an argument and we need to tell it once we're done, once new data is there and so on.
            <br>
            <code>
            let count = 0;<br>
              setInterval( () => &#123;<br></code>
            -> We can call the next method to emit a new value.<br>
          <code>
            observer.next(count);<br>
            count++;<br>
            }, 1000);<br>
            });<br> </code>
            -> An Observable instance begins publishing values only when someone subscribes to it. You subscribe by calling the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/observables#subscribing" target="_blank">subscribe()</a>  method of the instance, passing an observer object to receive the notifications.
            <br>
            <code>
            this.firstObsSubscription = customIntervalObservable.subscribe(data => &#123;<br>
            console.log(data);<br>
            });<br>

          <h5 class="card-title">Lesson  172. Errors & Completion </h5>
          <h6>ERROR:</h6>
          <p class="card-text"> The error observable method can be used to handler the error during the subscription, for example: </p>
          <p class="card-text"> <code> ngOnInit()  &#123;<br>
    const customIntervalObservable = new Observable(observer =>  &#123;<br>
            let count = 0;<br>
            setInterval( () =>  &#123;<br>
            observer.next(count);<br>
            count++;<br>
            if(count > 3)  &#123; </code><br>
            -> To emit the error message, we need to call the .error method <br>
            <code><b>observer.error(new Error('Count is greater 3!'));</b><br>
            }<br>
            }, 1000);<br>
            });<br>
    this.firstObsSubscription = customIntervalObservable.subscribe(data =>  &#123;<br>
            console.log(data);<br>
            }, <b>error</b> =>  &#123;<br>
            </code>
            -> to handler the error we need to pass another argument to subscribe<br>
            <code>
            console.log(error);
            });
            }</code></p>
          <h6>COMPLETE:</h6>
          <p class="card-text">  well then we simply call observer complete and there, you don't need to pass any arguments. <code>observer.complete(); </code> when you call complete, the observable will really come to a halt</p>

          <p>  <code>  this.firstObsSubscription = customIntervalObservable.subscribe(data =>  &#123;<br>
            console.log(data);<br>
            }, error =>  &#123;
            console.log(error);<br>
            }, () =>  &#123; <br></code>
            Now if you want to react to that completion, you can add a third arguments to the subscribe method and that is your completion handler function. It's a function that gets no arguments because completing doesn't pass any arguments and it's simply a function where you can do some cleanup work or whatever you need to do and here I'll just log completed. Also important, you don't need to unsubscribe<br>
            <code>
            console.log('Completed!');<br>
            });</code></p>

          <p class="card-text"> - </p>
          <p class="card-text">If for example we need to show the word 'Activate' after to push a button <code>&#60;button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="onActivate()">Activate&#60;/button>
          </code></p>
          <p class="card-text"> To do that we need a service Like: <br>
            <code>import &#123;EventEmitter, Injectable} from '@angular/core';<br>
              <br>
              @Injectable(&#123;providedIn: 'root'})<br>
              export class UserService &#123;<br>
              activatedEmitter = new EventEmitter&#60;boolean>();<br>

              }
            </code><br>
          and into the user.components.ts <br>
          <code>  onActivate()&#123;<br>
            this.userService.activatedEmitter.emit(true);<br>
            }</code><br>
            Thus far, nothing too fancy, that is a normal way of passing the data around or at least, of emitting an event across components.</p>

          <p class="card-text">  Now we want to listen to that event from inside the app component and for that, we simply inject the user service here too by using that injection shortcut also where we automatically bind it to a private property named user service and I'll then add a new property here too, user activated which is false initially and in ngOnInit, we can set up a listener, we can reach out to the user service, activated emitter and subscribe to it and in there, we get our did activate, or whatever you want to call it, boolean and we'll set user, this user activated equal to did activate and therefore whenever we emit true as a value here, user activated will switch to true
            <br> <code>constructor(private userService: UserService) &#123;} <br>
              <br>
              ngOnInit() &#123;<br>
              this.userService.activatedEmitter.subscribe( didActivate => &#123;<br>
              this.userActivated = didActivate;<br>
              });<br>
              }</code><br>and in the app.component.html file, that now means that we can use ngIf here to conditionally show that paragraph as soon as user activated is true. Let's save all of that and let's navigate to that user page here and let's click activate and indeed, we see activated here.
            <br><code>&#60;p *ngIf="userActivated" >Activate!&#60;/p></code><br>This is the old approach with the event emitter and this is an approach you could use but there is a better one, a more recommended one and that new approach, the better approach uses a subject.</p>

          <p class="card-text"> Now a subject is something we import from RxJS, SO you import subject from RxJS, instead of event emitter, you now create a subject here. Other than that, it's pretty similar though, it's a generic type where you define which data will eventually be emitted, in this case a boolean.
            <br><code>
              import &#123; Injectable} from '@angular/core';<br>
              import &#123; Subject} from 'rxjs';<br>

              @Injectable(&#123;providedIn: 'root'})<br>
              export class UserService &#123;<br>
              activatedEmitter = new Subject&#60;boolean>();<br>

              }
            </code></p>

          <p class="card-text">We also use it very similarly, in the user component we don't call emit however but something you saw before already, you call next because a subject is a special kind of observable you could say. <code>  onActivate()&#123;
            <br>
            this.userService.activatedEmitter.next(true); <br>
            }</code></p>
          <p class="card-text"> We know observables, we can subscribe to them as you learned but they're rather passive.You'll learn how to create your own observable but the core idea always is that you wrap a callback or an event or something like that. A subject is different, a subject also is an object you can subscribe to but it's more active because you can actively call next on it from outside. Remember in the observable, we also called next but that was from inside the observable when we created it. So that is a more active observable that is perfect when we want to use it as an event emitter, so if we don't have a passive event source, like an HTTP request or DOM events but if we have something that actively needs to be triggered by us in our application and that's exactly the use case we have here. We now can call next here in the user service on our activated emitter, the activated emitter is that subject and in the app component, we still call it subscribe because it is an observable and therefore, we can subscribe. If it now save that, you click activate again, it still works but now it's a subject and whilst it technically of course works in a similar way, using a subject is recommended way. Don't use event emitter,, use subjects they are in the end a bit more efficient behind the scenes, you can also now use all these cool operators because a subject in the end also is kind of an observable.</p>
